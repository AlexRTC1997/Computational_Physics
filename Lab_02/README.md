1. Write a code where Atwood's machine is employed to determine the magnitude of acceleration of two objects and the tension in the weightless rope.
2. A mobile with mass m travels a distance d in time t. Initially, it has an initial velocity vi and a final velocity vf. Write a code to determine the force described by the mobile at the moment of changing velocity and plot the process.
